## Naming rules

number-this_is_title-difficulty (e-easy, m-medium, h-hard)

"NEED O" and "TODO" mean that "need further work/optimization".

## Problem solving targets - start from 200

|  Date  |  Target  | Completion number | Completion date |
|:------:|:--------:|:-----------------:|:---------------:|
|  2-3   |   250    |        222        |       2-21      |
|  2-24  |   275    |                   |                 |

## TaoLu: general algorithms and frequent question summaries plan

1. DFS and BFS - taolu

2. Trie - 208

3. Backtracking
    - subsets: 78
    - permutation
    - combination sum: 39, 40, 216
    - palindrome partitioning
    - regex

4. Sorting
    - merge sort
    - quick sort
    - insertion sort
    - selection sort
    - counting sort

5. BST
    - self-balanced BST -- it seems that AVL tree and red-black tree won't be tested. (so they are put on some day later).

6. Bit manipulation
    - find the only element which exists once/twice... 
    - counting 1s

7. Math related

8. DP

9. KMP (Knuth–Morris–Pratt) algorithm - taolu, 214

10. Manacher’s algorithm - 647, 214

11. string parsing - 636

12. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree - 297

13. Print out a tree - taolu - not finished yet

14. Priority queue - 252, 253, 218
